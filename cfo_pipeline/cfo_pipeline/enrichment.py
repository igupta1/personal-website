"""CFO-pipeline enrichment.

Two-stage, mirrors ``insurance_pipeline.enrichment`` but with:

- SMB cap at 50 (per the spec — fractional CFO is a sub-50-employee
  product). Companies above that are buying a full-time CFO, not a
  fractional one.
- CFO-competitor pre-purge (CPA firms, bookkeeping shops, other
  fractional-CFO providers, accounting / advisory firms). They aren't
  prospects, they're the competition.
- Founder / CEO Gemini DM prompt. The buyer of a fractional CFO is
  the operator who currently signs the checks — the founder /
  president / managing partner — NOT the finance lead they're
  trying to hire (that person doesn't exist yet).

Re-enrichment is signal-aware: skip when industry is set and no source
signal has arrived since the last ``ENRICHMENT_RUN`` marker.

# --- OpenAI industry classification ---------------------------------------


_INDUSTRY_PROMPT = """\
Classify the company "{name}" into exactly one of these industry tags:
{tags}

Recent signals about this company: {signals}

Pick the single best-fitting tag.

Rules:
- Only use "fintech" for companies whose core product IS financial
  technology: payments, banking software, lending platforms,
  brokerage / trading tech, financial data services. A company
  whose name contains a financial-sounding word is NOT fintech.
- Use "real_estate" for property management, REITs, real-estate
  platforms, and farmland investment vehicles.
- Use "ecommerce_retail" for DTC brands, supplement / apparel
  brands, online retailers.
- Use "manufacturing" for hardware, semiconductors, industrial
  equipment, consumer-goods producers.
- Use "logistics_transport" for trucking, fleet operators, freight,
  delivery, including auto dealerships.
- Use "unknown" when you cannot confidently identify what the
  company does from name + signals. Do NOT guess "fintech" or
  "other" as a soft default. UNKNOWN is the correct answer when
  you're not sure.
